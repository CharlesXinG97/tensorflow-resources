# tensorflow-resources
Curated Tensorflow code resources to help you get started with Deep Learning.

## How is this repo structured?
Each folder in this repo is named after a section of Deep Learning.

For example,
the [basics]() folder contains code to get you started with the syntax of Tensorflow (or TF). The [projects]() folder contains real world predictions and classifications using TF.

Sometimes folders are also named with their respective algorithm names, like the [regression]() and [convolution_networks] folders.

## How do I use this repo?
Start out with the [hello_tensorflow.py] file, then checkout the [basics]()
folder, work your way through [basic_networks](), [costs_and_gradients], and finally [regression]() and [classification](). By this time, you should be comfortable enough to work with other complicated resources in this repo.
