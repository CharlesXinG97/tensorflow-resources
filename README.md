# tensorflow-resources
Curated Tensorflow code resources to help you get started with Deep Learning.

## How is this repo structured?
Each folder in this repo is named after a section of Deep Learning.

For example,
the [basics](basics) folder contains code to get you started with the syntax of Tensorflow (or TF). The [projects](projects) folder contains real world predictions and classifications using TF.

Sometimes folders are also named with their respective algorithm names, like the [regression](regression) and [convolution_networks](convolution_networks) folders.

## How do I use this repo?
Start out with the [hello_tensorflow.py](hello_tensorflow.py) file, then checkout the [basics](basics)
folder, work your way through [basic_networks](basic_networks), [costs_and_gradients](costs_and_gradients), and finally [regression](regression) and [classification](classification). By this time, you should be comfortable enough to work with other complicated resources in this repo.
